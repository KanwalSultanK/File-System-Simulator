# File-System-Simulator
File System Simulator is a lightweight Python application that models the core operations of a hierarchical file system. It allows users to create directories and files, navigate between folders, and visualize the structure of the file system. Designed for educational and prototyping purposes, the simulator provides a simplified yet functional environment for understanding how tree-based file systems operate.

The system includes support for:

- Creating and managing directories and files

- Navigating into subdirectories and moving to parent directories

- Listing the contents of the current directory

- Printing the entire file system hierarchy

With a clean and interactive command-line interface, File System Simulator offers an accessible way for students, developers, and researchers to explore the fundamentals of file system organization and path management in Python.
